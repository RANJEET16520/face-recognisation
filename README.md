Designed a Face-Recognizer in Python. It is an application used to detect the faces of the persons. OpenCV is used in Python to create this project. It works efficiently to detect the faces.Its features are as:

– Faces are captured using Haar cascade.

– Data is trained in trainner module for recognition of faces.

– Faces are recognized as per the data of the person trained in the modules. The LBPHFacerecognizer is used to recognize the faces.

### Technologies Used
